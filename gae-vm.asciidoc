= Using PubNub Python SDK on GAE managed vm

Pubnub python sdk has dependency on pycrypto module. To have pycrypto installed on 
managed vm, add following lines to your Docker file.

```
 RUN apt-get update
 RUN apt-get -y install python-crypto
```

To include pubnub in your application, you can use vendoring defined here 
https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/tools/libraries27#vendoring

Create a directory lib in your application root

```
mkdir lib
```

create (or modify) appengine_config.py in root of project, and add

```
from google.appengine.ext import vendor

# Add any libraries installed in the "lib" folder.
vendor.add('lib')
```

Then run

```
pip install -t lib pubnub
```
